# Eagle_Earth
Selling flowers to brighten up the future. We have a wide selection of flowers from Perennials to Roses for bringing a happier feeling to landscapes.

Hi, my name is Madison Granger, and my partners in this project are Tori Trice and Kiley Chilcutt. I made the idea of the Eagle Earth site back in 2020 because it was springtime and who wouldn’t want flowers for their yard to make everything look better? However, I had to move the idea of this site to this year due to covid, but that is a-okay with me because it’s still springtime. I worked on some of the front-end of the website -- but mainly the back-end-- while Tori and Kiley worked on more of the frontend of the website.

The front-end of the website wasn’t a tough task due to us knowing how to design one, but the only area that was a little bit of a challenge was the slideshows that I made out of JavaScript. This was because I couldn’t figure out how to put multiple slideshows on one page; However, it didn’t take me too long to fix that problem because, believe it or not, the PHP that I learned helped me read and figure out JavaScript better.

Furthermore, we teamed up with our FFA club to make most of the photos on the site are real. I also took pictures for the backgrounds of the website and the store. I decided to give the store background a blurred effect because I thought it would look better. You’ll find those backgrounds in the images folder.

Now if we go more into the back-end of things it gets more complicated --especially when you’re the only one in your team that can read php and sql code a bit better. I spent a couple of weeks on the login, logout, and signup system in which it wasn’t necessarily difficult to do, but rather a tedious process to figure out.

However, adding items and their quantities to the cart was the most difficult part to do out of the whole website. To be more specific, there was a lot more trial and error in this area than everywhere else in the website, and it took up so much time to a point that I didn’t get to add checks to billing.php and cardinfo.php.

A couple of problems that I wasn’t able to solve in time were session problems. There were a couple of foreign key problems in my billing info and card info tables. Which I would’ve most likely been able to fix those, but I would’ve had a hard time fix the PHP for it. However, I want to figure out those problems even after the competition because I want to know to how to make a website fully-fully functional.

Overall, the making of the front-end of the website went great, but the back-end of it was very challenging. While the back-end may still have some little kinks in it, I still had a fun time making the website as functional as I could, and for Tori and Kiley, they had a fun time as well. Working as a team together was very fun and everytime we worked together we were full of smiles and laughter. While I might’ve been the only one to work with the PHP and SQL of the group, I’m okay with that because as someone who is going to major in computer science for the next four years of their life, I believe I was able to learn those languages way better. In other words, I have no regret at all in doing this competition again because it was a growing experience.
